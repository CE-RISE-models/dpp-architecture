# Aims & Objectives

The aim of the CE-RISE DPP data model architecture is to make Digital Product Passports interoperable and generate value to users through proper representation of information and data.

## Core Objectives

### Proper Information Representation

We aim to represent information that is:
* **Complete** - capturing all necessary data for DPP functionality
* **Formal** - following structured, standardized formats
* **Semantically aligned** - ensuring consistent meaning across systems and contexts

### Future-Proofing

The architecture is designed to be future-proof for:
* Always evolving regulations and standards
* New data requirements and compliance needs
* Technological advances and platform changes

### Enabling Interoperability

We enable interoperability by:
* Supporting pluggable models that can be mixed and matched
* Allowing competing models for the same purpose without catastrophic cascading effects
* Preventing obsolescence or incompatibility in other parts of DPPs
* Separating lifecycle concerns from regulatory requirements

### Semantic Web Vision

The ultimate aim is to harness the potential of automatic mappings and discoveries as envisioned in the semantic web - making sense of all the ontologies and enabling systems to automatically understand and work with diverse data models and standards.

This approach ensures that Digital Product Passports can adapt, evolve, and maintain their value as the regulatory landscape and technological ecosystem continues to develop.
