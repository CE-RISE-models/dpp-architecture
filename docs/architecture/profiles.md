# Profiles

## Model Composition Flexibility

The CE-RISE DPP architecture allows users to freely select and combine models based on their specific needs. 

### Core Foundation
Every DPP implementation starts with:
- **`product-profile`** - The required identity layer
- **DPP Metadata models** - For record management (when available)

### Adding Value Through Selection
Users can then add any combination of models from the Value-Added Information Layers and Cross-Cutting Utility Layers based on:
- Industry requirements
- Regulatory compliance needs
- Business objectives
- Data availability
- Stakeholder needs

### No Prescribed Profiles
Rather than forcing predefined profiles, the architecture empowers users to:
- Start with minimal models and expand over time
- Combine models that make sense for their use case
- Adapt to changing requirements without restructuring
- Maintain interoperability while customizing their approach

This flexibility ensures that the DPP architecture can serve diverse industries and use cases without unnecessary complexity or constraints.
