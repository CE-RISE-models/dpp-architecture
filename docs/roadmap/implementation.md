## Legend

- ✅ **Completed**: Model is fully developed, documented, and published
- 🔄 **Under Development**: Model is actively being developed
- 📋 **Planned**: Model is planned for future development

## Next Steps

Development priority will be given to models that support immediate CE-RISE project needs and regulatory requirements, particularly those in the Dynamic Lifecycle and Impact Assessment layers.
