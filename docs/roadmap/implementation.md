# Implementation Plan

## Development Status

The following table shows the current development status of all planned models in the CE-RISE DPP architecture:

| Layer | Model | Status | Repository | Notes |

| **Dynamic Lifecycle Layer** |
| | `traceability-and-life-cycle-events` | Under Development | - | Dynamic traceability and supply-chain events |
| | `diagnostic-results` | Planned | - | Event-bound diagnostic outputs |
| **Operation & Use Layer** |
| | `usage-and-maintenance` | Planned | - | Usage and maintenance data and instructions |
| **Impact Assessment Layer** |
| | `integrated-lca` | Planned | - | Environmental and social LCA data |
| | `see-impacts-specification` | Planned | - | CE-RISE SEE module support |
| **Circularity & End-of-Life Layer** |
| | `circularity-and-eol` | Planned | - | Circularity and end-of-life information |
| | `re-indicators-specification` | Under Development | [RE Indicators Specification](../components/re-indicators-specification.md) | EoL indicators and options |
| **Legal, Compliance & Standards Layer** |
| | `compliance-and-standards` | Planned | - | Regulatory compliance and certifications |
| | `some-specification` | Planned | - | Compliance specification layer |

| **Technical Infrastructure Layer** |
| | `technical-infrastructure` | Planned | - | Technical metadata and interoperability |

## Legend

* **Completed**: Model is fully developed, documented, and published
* **Under Development**: Model is actively being developed
* **Planned**: Model is planned for future development

## Next Steps

Development priority will be given to models that support immediate CE-RISE project needs and regulatory requirements, particularly those in the Dynamic Lifecycle and Impact Assessment layers.
