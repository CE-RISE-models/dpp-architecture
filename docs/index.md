# CE-RISE Digital Product Passport (DPP) Data Model Architecture

Welcome to the documentation for the CE-RISE Digital Product Passport (DPP) data model architecture. This site explains the approach to data modeling developed and adopted in the CE-RISE project for creating interoperable, future-proof Digital Product Passports.

## What You'll Find Here

This documentation is organized to guide you through our modular approach to DPP data modeling:

### Approach

Start here to understand our vision and methodology:

* **[Aims & Objectives](approach/aims.md)** - Why we built this architecture and what it achieves
* **[Our Approach](approach/principles.md)** - Bottom-up modular design with the product-profile foundation

### Architecture

Explore the technical structure:

* **[Architecture Overview](architecture/index.md)** - Visual representation and model-level structure
* **[Profiles](architecture/profiles.md)** - How to compose models for specific use cases

### Components
Need details about a specific data model? Navigate through available data models and find references to more info.

### Roadmap

Track implementation status and upcoming model availability:

* **[Implementation Plan](roadmap/implementation.md)** - Current status of model development and what's coming next

## Quick Start

1. **New to DPP modeling?** Begin with [Aims & Objectives](approach/aims.md) to understand the vision
2. **Want to see the structure?** Go to [Architecture Overview](architecture/index.md) for the big picture
3. **Need details about specific models?** Navigate through Components for references to model repositories and schemas
4. **Planning a project?** Review the [Implementation Plan](roadmap/implementation.md) for model availability status
