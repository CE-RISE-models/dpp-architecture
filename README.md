# CE-RISE DPP & DMP Architecture Documentation

This repository contains the source files for the CE-RISE Digital Product and Material Passport (DPP & DMP) data model architecture documentation website, published at: [https://ce-rise-models.codeberg.page/dp-architecture/](https://ce-rise-models.codeberg.page/dp-architecture/)

The documentation website explains the approach to data modeling developed and adopted in the CE-RISE project for Digital Product and Material Passports. **For the actual documentation content, please visit the published website.**

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:
- Source for the documentation website built with MkDocs Material
- Version control for documentation content and structure
- CI/CD pipeline for automatic website deployment

## Updating Documentation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MkDocs Material theme

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://codeberg.org/ce-rise-models/dpp-architecture.git
   cd dpp-architecture
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs-material
   ```

3. Start local development server:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

4. View the site at `http://localhost:8000`

### Adding Content

1. Create or edit Markdown files in the `docs/` directory
2. Update the navigation structure in `mkdocs.yml` if adding new pages
3. Commit and push changes to the `main` branch

### Automatic Deployment

The documentation website is automatically built and deployed via Forgejo Actions when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The workflow:

1. Builds the MkDocs site
2. Deploys to Codeberg Pages
3. Makes the site available at the published URL
